        <p>Hi! I&apos;m Noah &#x1F44B;</p>
          <br />
          <p className="mb-4">I’m currently a full-time <strong>Android Mobile Developer</strong> at 
          <a href="https://www.grindr.com/" className="mb-4 text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"><em> Grindr</em></a>, where I help bring new features to the app as part of the Android Development team. I joined Grindr in April 2024 as the youngest hire on the team after graduating early from the University of Chicago with a 3.7 GPA, earning a degree in Economics and Computer Science.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">During my time at <strong>Grindr</strong>, I’ve continued to build on my passion for mobile development by contributing to high-impact features and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative features that improve the user experience.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">While at the <strong>University of Chicago</strong>, I was deeply involved in various activities beyond academics. I was a student-athlete playing Varsity Baseball, where I earned All-Conference honors. Additionally, I served on the executive board of my fraternity, Psi Upsilon, as Treasurer, where I managed, organized, and oversaw all financial aspects of the organization.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">In the Summer of &apos;23 I had the opportunity to work as an <strong>Android Platform Engineer Intern</strong> at 
          <a href="https://www.grindr.com/" className="mb-4 text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"><em> Grindr</em></a>; during my time there I was actively working with and uploading code in production. I modernized the analytics infrastructure by integrating a deprecated analytics class with the current version, optimizing it through my understanding of dependency injection and MVVM. Additionally, I led a significant project involving in-depth research, a complete redesign, and diligent testing to introduce a robust circuit breaker mechanism to enhance our application&apos;s dependability.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before Grindr, during the summer of &apos;22, I previously worked as a <strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong> at <a href="https://riis.com/" className="mb-4 text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-500"><em>RIIS LLC</em></a>, developing applications specific to commerical drones!</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Although I am not actively seeking full-time positions, I am always open to exploring new opportunities, collaborations, and networking.
